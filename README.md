# Meal Friend
I have trouble thinking of what to plan for our family meals on a weekly basis.  We tend to pick the same things over and over again. Even though we occasionally enjoy cooking interesting meals, I forget about those and rely the easy choices when pressed for time. 

# Requirements
* I can enter an existing meal plan into a form.
  * a meal plan is a collection of dates with associated entrees/sides/desserts.  
  * Entree / Side / Dessert
    * When I choose an autosuggsted item it appears in the list. 
    * When i choose to create one, a form opens which allows: 
      * item type (entree/dessert/side)
      * URL (to recipe?)
      * prep text, prep reminder date
      * save
* I can be reminded of today's meal.
* I can be reminded of a prep necessary for tomorrow's meal (i.e. soak the beans, make the dough).
* I can see a list of meals and sort by frequency or popularity. 
* I can rate a meal.
* I see auto-suggestions of entrees/sides/desserts when entering them into a meal plan.
